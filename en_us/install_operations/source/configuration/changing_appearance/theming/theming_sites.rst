Using Sites for Theming
#######################

You can configure multiple sites within your Open edX installation. A site
presents your Open edX courses and content in an individual way. You can
configure sites independently of each other. For example, you can assign
different themes to your Open edX sites.

By default, an Open edX installation has one site. The default site is what
users interact with when they visit your site. You do not need to add multiple sites to your Open edX installation. You can apply themes to the default site.
