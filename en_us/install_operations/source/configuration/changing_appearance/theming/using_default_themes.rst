Open edX software includes default themes that you can apply or use as patterns for your own custom themes.

For the LMS and Studio, default themes are in the ``themes`` directory of the ``edx/edx-platform`` repository.

For Ecommerce, default themes are in the ``ecommerce/themes`` directory of the ``edx/ecommerce`` repository.
